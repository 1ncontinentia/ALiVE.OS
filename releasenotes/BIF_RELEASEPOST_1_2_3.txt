[b]Hotfixes![/b]
Again another hotfix release. These releases are like London buses, you can wait around for ages for one to turn up and then 4 come at once... Anyway, once again thank you to the continued great feedback from the community. This release sees [b]Whigital[/b] pop his Github cherry pushing several widespread code optimisations. We also fixed some regressions, [b]ACE[/b] kills now get logged on War Room and we also fixed an issue with persistence missions getting stuck on the loading screen.

If you do have any persistent mission issues please contact us on our forum for support!

Thanks to everyone for feedback both here and on our forum!

[b]Are you using Linux?[/b]
ALiVE is fully supported on a Linux Dedicated Server (as well as Windows). In fact the ALiVE Official Server for testing is running Ubuntu. Here are some tips on getting ALiVE running smoothly on Linux and integrated with War Room - [url=http://www.alivemod.com/forum/1916-setting-up-linux-dedi-server]http://www.alivemod.com/forum/1916-setting-up-linux- dedi-server[/url]
