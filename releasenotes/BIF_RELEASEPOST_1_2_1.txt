[b]Critical Fixes and Updates, ACE IED compatibility, Side Mission improvements[/b]
Following on from the amazing addition of the ORBATRON aka The Orbatterrer, SpyderBlack continues to add fixes and updates to the only in game faction creator around. Its a seminal piece of work where wanna-be faction modders can finally make their OPFOR dreams come true. SpyderBlack has added the ability to custom unit ethnicity, language, and insignia. Vehicles can now be further customized and specifiyng different crew classes per turret. The entire ORBAT Creator has also received a visual lift and an influx of new export options. All of this has been rounded out with some splendid general fixes to provide a smooth experience.

Meanwhile we had several reports that the ALiVE helicopter pilots level of service has been dismal. Everything from forgetting to drop off supplies to not even bothering to slingload supplies were some of the main complaints. Apparently, even factions without helo's had access to OPFOR helo resupply, leaving many commanders in the field wondering if the Russians were up to something. Suffice to say Tupolov has contacted the various combat service supply units and given them a good bollocking. Helo resupply and logistics now reliably deliver to requests and factions can be limited so they don't resupply using someone elses chopper. 

We had several requests to support ACE IED's in the ALiVE IED threat module and ALiVE Asymmetric Warfare options. Tupolov has implemented a system that supports most third party IED mods, as long as those mods are using vanilla "mines" as the base class for their IEDs. More feedback welcome on our GitHub.

Command and Control also received some improvements. Aircraft can now assume a hybrid role of both Transport and CAS (using the CS_TYPE = "hybrid" value) when using the Combat Support module. There were also reports (thanks Shukari!) of HQ not using appropriate voice protocol for tasking (C2ISTAR), this has been fixed. Don't forget about the cool "side missions" now part of ALiVE, we now support the following taskings (auto generated if you like):

[*] Assault on a military installation 
[*] Defence of a military installation 
[*] Assault on a civilian installation
[*] Assassination of a HVT
[*] Hostage Rescue
[*] Combat Search and Rescue
[*] Transport insertion
[*] Seek and destroy enemy infantry
[*] Seek and destroy enemy vehicles
[*] Sabotage a military/civilian installation
[*] Patrol an area (as an insurgent)
[*] Destroy military assets (as an insurgent)

Minor fixes include addressing an error that was only apparent when player persistence was turned off and players disconnected from a mission using persistence. Auto pause of virtual AI and relevant systems when there were no players on the server has also been fixed, ensuring AI insurgents don't spread across the map like wild fire.

Minor updates include new ZEC composition updates (thank you ZEC!) and improved error handling when OPCOM factions have not been placed on the map.

Again, we had a bunch of people that didn't want to use ALiVE due to us overriding the vanilla ABORT button, well we've fixed that, so for those of you that had push back from clan members due to this, let them know!

Thanks to everyone for feedback both here and on our forum!
