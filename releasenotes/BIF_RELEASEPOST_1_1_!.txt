[size=4]The next generation dynamic persistent mission addon for ArmA3[/size][/b][/center]

[center][b]Release 1.1.1[/b][/center]

[b]Apex Fixes![/b]
This is minor release to fix a number of issues identified in 1.1.  Key amongst them are refinements to the new slingloading feature - you can choose how many boxes spawn (including none) and selecting objects for hook up is much more intuitive. Variables for slingloading have been added for manually placed transport helis (see Combat Support wiki for details).

Civilians have migrated to the new land known as Tanoa and will now show their faces when asked.  Spyderblack's mini-mod that splits up the factions lumped into CIV_F is included in this release, so you can specify which civ faction you want to spawn.

We have also added support for mission specific compositions, so any comps that you build in the editor and save with your mission will be spawned by Mil Placement modules.  Note that if they are named the same, mission defined comps will take precedence so you can effectively replace any standard ALiVE comp with your own at the mission level.

Thanks to everyone for feedback both here and on our forum!

ALiVE is fully supported on a Linux Dedicated Server (as well as Windows). In fact the ALiVE Official Server for testing is running Ubuntu. Here are some tips on getting ALiVE running smoothly on Linux and integrated with War Room - [url=http://www.alivemod.com/forum/1916-setting-up-linux-dedi-server]http://www.alivemod.com/forum/1916-setting-up-linux- dedi-server[/url]
