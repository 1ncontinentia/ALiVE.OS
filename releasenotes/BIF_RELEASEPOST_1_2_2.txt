[b]Hotfixes![/b]
Thanks to the diligence of some our community members, we identified and fixed several annoying bugs and also took the chance to close out a number of small enhancement requests. We want to say thanks to Shukari for great bug reports and help in testing out ALiVE (and his first Pull Request!). Also to CoachWN, EasyEB and AUTigerGrad for bug reports and feature requests.

Fixes:
Logistics and C2ISTAR modules received a number of fixes to slingloading and tasks as well as placement of supplies, incorrectly orientated/composed compositions were fixed and there are minor fixes to the ORBATRON. Shukari fixed a stuttering bug and popped his cherry with a pull request!

Enhancements:
MarcelDev89 improved the player resupply UI by adding classname tooltips, Tupolov added an option to disable OPCOM roadblocks, added more patrols around compositions and improved UI/interaction with hostages/downed pilots.SpyderBlack updated ORBATRON to support Zeus and turrets.

Thanks to everyone for feedback both here and on our forum!

ALiVE is fully supported on a Linux Dedicated Server (as well as Windows). In fact the ALiVE Official Server for testing is running Ubuntu. Here are some tips on getting ALiVE running smoothly on Linux and integrated with War Room - [url=http://www.alivemod.com/forum/1916-setting-up-linux-dedi-server]http://www.alivemod.com/forum/1916-setting-up-linux- dedi-server[/url]
