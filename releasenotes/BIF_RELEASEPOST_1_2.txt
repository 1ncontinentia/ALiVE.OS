[b]Compositions, Civilians and The Factionator[/b]
If you have ever wanted to make your own custom faction config but been scared by the complexities of CfgFactions, or tweak unit loadouts and groups configurations to remove all those pesky UGL units but didn't know where to begin, then you'll love this.  SpyderBlack has really pulled it out of the bag and done some amazing work.  The ALiVE Order of Battle Creator, also known as the Orbatterer (we're struggling for catchy names) is a fully in-game graphical tool for creating and editing unit, group and faction configs, which can then be exported and used in missions or packed into pbo files as addon override.  You need @ALiVE to use the tool but once exported, your faction override config can be used standalone (though obviously you'll need the original addons).  Full instructions for how to use this new tool are on the wiki.

Meanwhile Tupolov has been adding lots of new toys.  With massive thanks to lsd, we have integrated his entire collection of ZEC and ZECCUP compositions into ALiVE.  They will be used by Mil Placement modules as well as random camps and are fully supported by the Custom Objectives module.  In addition, compositions can now be faction specific.  Don't forget that we recently added support for mission level compositions as well.  Details are on the wiki.

You will find 2 new tasks in the C2ISTAR module, also thanks to Tup.  Combat Search and Rescue has you scrambling to find and rescue a downed heli crew before they get overrun by the enemy.  Hostage Rescue is a race against time to remove a captured agent from the grips of the dastardly bad guys.  Feel free to submit ideas on github or better yet, make your own tasks and submit them via a Pull Request!

Thanks to everyone for feedback both here and on our forum!

ALiVE is fully supported on a Linux Dedicated Server (as well as Windows). In fact the ALiVE Official Server for testing is running Ubuntu. Here are some tips on getting ALiVE running smoothly on Linux and integrated with War Room - [url=http://www.alivemod.com/forum/1916-setting-up-linux-dedi-server]http://www.alivemod.com/forum/1916-setting-up-linux- dedi-server[/url]
