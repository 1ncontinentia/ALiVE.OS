[b]More Hotfixes and Enhancements![/b]
We have quickly shipped another update to ALiVE. The last release had a slight build issue ahem, no worries, it didn't break anything, but we're releasing another 1.2.2 (build 1611241) to compensate. 

Fixes:
This build fixes a few issues related to ORBATRON, profile spawns with civ_placement/mil_command modules and a long standing logistics persistence save issue.

Enhancements:
We've only gone and added persistent compositions! They weren't get persisted before, so scouting out roadblocks or enemy outposts was slightly spoilt when on mission restart some would change. We've also fixed an issue where roadblocks were not getting spawned on a mission restart. SpyderBlack has also started some optimisation work making some of our code 20% faster.

Thanks to everyone for feedback both here and on our forum!
