ALiVE

Developed by the team that brought you Multi Session Operations (MSO), the Advanced Light Infantry Virtual Environment (ALiVE) is an easy to use modular mission framework that provides everything players and mission makers need to quickly set up and run realistic military operations in almost any scenario, including command, combat support, service support, logistics and more.

Main Features

ALiVE features the revolutionary *Virtual Profile System* that supports thousands of units operating simultaneously across the map with minimal impact on performance.  Unlike older caching systems, Virtual AI groups will continue to move, operate and fight and will seamlessly spawn into the visual game world when players are in range.

ALiVE identifies key military, industrial and civilian installations automatically for any map. It uses an advanced, multi-layered AI *Operational Command* structure which assesses the strategic, operational and tactical situation across the battlespace, analyses the relative strengths of enemy and friendly forces and issues missions accordingly. The result is a fluid, dynamic and credibly realistic battlefield as forces modelled on real world Combined Arms doctrines fight for key objectives.

The second generation *Persistent Campaign* system automatically retains mission critical data on an external database without any user installations required - no need for complicated MySQL databases, it is all handled completely automatically!

ALiVE have created and fully integrated the *aliveMod.com War-Room*, which tracks operations in near-realtime and provides powerful analytical tools to review every kill and every shot fired.

ALiVE also provides a variety of popular *Player Support* utilities such as View Distance, Respawn and Revive Manager, Long Range Communications Rebroadcast for ACRE and an integrated Support Radio Suite for AI controlled Combat and Combat Service Support.

The intuitive, easy to use *modular framework* means mission making with ALiVE is quick and easy, even if you have never opened the editor before.  Simply place modules down and play.  ALiVE can be used completely stand alone or as part of more complex missions and scripts.

Further information, including details of the technical innovations behind ALiVE and the full development history can be found on the wiki

Overview
-------------
ALiVE is the next generation dynamic persistent mission mod for Arma 3. Developed by a group of veteran Arma community members (responsible for the MSO mission framework) and a number of current and former serving military personnel, the easy to use modular mission framework provides everything that players and mission makers need to set up and run realistic military operations in almost any scenario, including command, combat support, service support and logistics.


Mission makers can quickly and easily create epic, large scale, whole map missions in both single and multiplayer environments.  ALiVE enables mission makers to bypass the difficulties of complex scripting and challenging performance issues.  It is compatible with custom factions, terrains, units and add-ons, even zombies!


ALiVE features autonomous AI Commanders that plan and direct missions for all AI forces across the Area of Operations, identifying strategic objectives and reacting to changes in the tactical situation.  Both AI and player forces are supported by a fully integrated logistics system that realistically models the tactical challenges of sustaining supply lines and battlefield resupply.


The revolutionary Virtual Profile System can support thousands of units operating simultaneously across the map with minimal impact on performance. All of this is tracked and persisted via a cloud based database. The result is a realistic and constantly changing battlefield which truly brings Arma 3 ALiVE.

Installation

Run as any normal mod on your ArmA3 install -mod=@CBA_A3;@ALiVE
If using a Dedicated Server use the following:  -mod=@CBA_A3;@ALiVEServer;@ALiVE

-------------------
In-Game Help
-------------------
There are several entries in the Field Manual which will guide you through interacting with key in game ALiVE features.

By default, ALiVE uses the App Key to open the ALiVE interaction menu.  The app key is found next to your right control key. If you do not have an app key or wish to use a different binding, you can map User Key 20 in the game options menu. Note custom key bindings do not support modifiers (CTRL, ALT or SHIFT). You will need to restart Arma for this to take effect. 

Some features will require that you carry a Laser Designator (or custom item defined in the editor modules).

For Advanced Markers, access the map and press CTRL LMB to place or edit a marker. Press CTRL RMB to delete a marker.

For Quick Markers, access the map and press [ to choose your marker mode, CTRL LMB once to start drawing, CTRL LMB once to finish.

See the Field Manual for more information.

ALiVE War Room
------------------------
We highly recommend that you (as a player or a group admin) register with our ALiVE War Room! Go here:


http://alivemod.com/user/register


When registering on War Room you have the chance to create a group or join a current group if they are accepting applications.  If you register a group, you will able to register one or more servers to enable database persistence, player stats and AAR.

In order to capture data properly with ALiVE and ensure mission persistence, players should always use the PLAYER EXIT button when on a dedicated server. Administrators should use the SERVER SAVE AND EXIT button when wanting to close down an MP session on a dedicated server. Both these buttons are available by pressing ESC to get to the main menu while in game.

Gameplay
--------------
ALiVE is a dynamic campaign mission framework. The editor placed modules are designed to be intuitive but highly flexible, empowering mission makers to create a huge range of different scenarios by simply placing a few modules and markers. The AI Commanders have an overall mission and a prioritised list of objectives that they work through autonomously. Players can choose to tag along with the AI and join the fight, tackle their own objectives or just sit back and watch it all unfold.


Mission makers may wish to experiment by synchronizing different modules to each other, or using standalone ALiVE modules as a backdrop for dynamic missions and campaigns, enhancing scenarios created with traditional editing techniques. ALiVE significantly reduces the effort required to make a complex mission by adding ambience, support and persistence at the drop of a module.


-------------------
How It Works
-------------------
ALiVE is complex but not complicated. Each module is standalone but they can be synchronised to each other to create different scenarios. The modules work independently but will use data derived from another module if it is synchronised. This layered approach provides a high degree of flexibility and allows you to build custom scenarios quickly.


Everything starts with the Placement modules. These modules fulfill two important functions: they identify a list of military and civilian objectives or areas of importance across the map and secondly, they place the AI groups. There are several module parameters for customising the type of objectives and also the shape and size of the AI forces. Refer to the Military and Civilian Placement Module pages for further details on these.


If an Operational Commander (OPCOM) is placed, it will take command of all available AI forces of its faction. However, OPCOM needs to know where its objectives are and this is simply done by Synchronising it to one or more Placements Modules.
Note that OPCOM does not exclusively take command of the units defined in the Placement modules, it is only using them to get a list of objectives. OPCOM will take command of all units of its faction across the map.


So for example you could place an OPFOR Military Placement module to occupy an area of the map, but synch a BLUFOR OPCOM to it so it knows to attack those objectives.
Another example: place a Civilian Placement module with no Unit Placement so it is only providing a list of objectives. Then place a BLUFOR Military Placement Module in a small zone nearby with and set it to a Platoon of Light Infantry. Synch a BLUFOR OPCOM in Invasion mode to both Placement modules and watch as the Infantry are ordered to attack the civilian objectives.


Using different combinations of modules it is possible to quickly create a huge range of scenarios, from massive tank battles to intense urban counter insurgency. The best way is to experiment!
