- All methods should take an OPCOM object not datahandler hash

- OPCOM base class function should use the following format when calling itself

_class = _logic getvariable ["mainclass",""];
[_logic,_operation, _args] call _class

This will allow it to handle inherited classes that have overridden base class methods

Implement objective debug markers -- toggleable with opcom debug operation
